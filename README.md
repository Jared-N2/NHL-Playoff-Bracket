# Description
As sports fans, we wanted to create a website the allows users to create a NHL playoff bracket.  Users can login, then make one or multiple brackets, delete a bracket and track their favorite hockey team through to the Stanley Cup Championship- Go Avalanche!!!
A MVC model was coded using Sequelize, Express, Javascript, CSS, MySQL database, Handlebars and deployed through Heroku.


# Usage
By using a simple UI/UX design the website allows users to easily navigate and create a bracket.
